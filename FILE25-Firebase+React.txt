CHAPTER-1 : WHAT IS A FIREBASE?
    - Firebase is a set of backend cloud computing services and application development platforms provided by Google.
    
    - It hosts databases, services, authentication, and integration for a variety of applications, including Android, iOS, JavaScript, Node.js, Java, Unity, PHP, and C++. 
    
    - Discover Firebase, Google's mobile and web app development platform that helps developers build apps and games that users will love.


CHAPTER-2 : STEPS FOR TO CREATE A FIREBASE SERVICE.
    STEP-1 :
        - Go to Firebase official website and login with your google account.

    STEP-2 :
        - Click on Go to Console button. It is comes under navigation bar(Right Side)

    STEP-3 : 
        - When you are into the firebase console page you can click on CREATE A PROJECT button.

    STEP-4 :
        - Enter your project name ("youtube-app" => This is my project name) and click on the continue button and then disabled google analytic option then click to CREATE PROJECT button. 
        - After that it will take a time to create a new project and then click on CONTINUE button to continue.

    STEP-5 :
        - After that you will get a new project profile page.

    STEP-6 :
        - In your project profile page, at the right side of your menu you will get a so many options.(BUILD, RUN, ANALYTICS)

    STEP-7 :
        - Click on the BUILD option and you will get a so many options.
            -> AUTHENTICATION(This is a Service) is available, and you can use it to configure of the authentication like google and github. By using this authentication you can configure the users.
            
            -> FIRE STORE DATABASE(This is a Service) is available, and this is a document based database. This is a popular database. We are using this database in our project.
            
            -> It will maintain the database in form of document structure.

            -> REAL TIME DATABASE(This is a Service) is available, and it looks like a fire store database. If you are update any data here, our app will be updated automatically.
            
            -> It will maintain the database in form of tree structure.

            -> STORE(This is a Service) is available, and it keeps the data like files, photos and videos which is uploaded by the user. It's like a cloud storage service.

            -> HOSTING(This is a Service) is available, and it is used for to host your application.

            -> FUNCTIONS, MACHINE LEARNING(This is a Service) is available, and these are the basic overview of firebase.


CHAPTER-3 : HOW TO SET UP A REACT AND FIREBASE PROJECT?
    STEP 1: 
        - Create a new REACT application.
    
    STEP 2: 
        - Go to the FIREBASE PROJECT profile page, in that page you will see the title like "Get started by adding Firebase to your app"
    
    STEP 3:
        - Below the title of your FIREBASE PROJECT profile page, you will see the ICONS like iOS, ANDROID and WEB.
    
    STEP 4: 
        - Clicking on the WEB icon, you will get a page which helps to connect with the web app.
    
    STEP 5: 
        - In the connection(Add Firebase to your web App) page, you will get a text box for to register your web app and my application name is "youtube-web-app" then click on the REGISTER APP" button.

    STEP 6: 
        - After you have registered you will get a cmd NPM I FIREBASE.

    STEP 7: 
        - Go back to the react app and install the cmd i.e NPM I FIREBASE

    STEP 8: 
        - After installing the cmd then, initialize Firebase and begin using the SDKs for the products that you'd like to use.

            -> So that create firebase.js file inside the SRC react app and copy the firebase SKD form the firebase connection page and paste it into the firebase.js file.

            -> This FIREBASE SDK helps you connect to the react app.

            -> After that click on the CONTINUE TO THE CONSOLE button.

            -> After click on the CONTINUE TO THE CONSOLE button you will get FIREBASE project profile page. 

            -> In that page, Below the firebase project name you will get 1 app option. It means one react application connected to the firebase project.

            -> If you click on the 1 app option you will get the web app name i.e "youtube-web-app".

    STEP 9:
        - Verify the connection between the firebase project and the react app.
            
            -> Click on the REAL TIME DATABASE service option (It comes under BUILD left side menu in your firebase project profile page).
            
            -> Now, you are into the REAL TIME DATABASE service page and click on CREATE DATABASE button.
            
            -> You will get a dialog box with dropdown. In that dropdown select real time database location i.e UNITED STATES(us-central1). Default option and click on NEXT button.
            
            -> After that you will get a security rules option in the same dialog box.
            
            -> Click on the second radio button i.e for START IN TEST MODE because in that mode you will get a read and write capability. Where in the first options you won't and click on the ENABLE button.
            
            -> This helps you to create a real time database and you will get DATABASE URL also.

    STEP 10: 
        - You can copy the DATABASE URL from the console box and go to firebase.js file.

    STEP 11: 
        - In this file please update firebaseConfig object with databaseURL key and save it. So here I added firebase DATABASE url in the firebase.js file.

    STEP 12: 
        - Go to App.js file and 
            import { getDatabase } from "firebase/database";
            import { app } from "./firebase";

    STEP 13: 
        - Updated firebase.js file code as shown in below

            // Import the functions you need from the SDKs you need
            import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
            // TODO: Add SDKs for Firebase products that you want to use
            // https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#available-libraries

            // Your web app's Firebase configuration
            const firebaseConfig = {
                apiKey: "AIzaSyAzACZiZRKIUkrQ4zfcXf-hxyU5PjWxoQY",
                authDomain: "app-d8c4e.firebaseapp.com",
                projectId: "app-d8c4e",
                storageBucket: "app-d8c4e.appspot.com",
                messagingSenderId: "50991172825",
                appId: "1:50991172825:web:b19c684cf3b91518e4c2c8",
                databaseURL: "https://app-d8c4e-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com",
            };

            // Initialize Firebase
            export const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);

    STEP 14: 
        - Updated App.js file code as shown in the below

            import { getDatabase, ref, set } from "firebase/database";
            import { app } from "./firebase";
            import "./App.css";

            const db = getDatabase(app);
            function App() {
            // TO STORE A DATA INTO THE DATABASE
            const putData = () => {
                set(ref(db, "users/javed"), {
                id: 1,
                name: "Javed Hosamani",
                age: 21,
                });
            };

            return (
                <div className="App">
                    <h1>Firebase React App</h1>
                    <button onClick={putData}>Put Data</button>
                </div>
            );
            }

            export default App;

    STEP-5:
        - Go to App.js file and update your settings.

            // import { getDatabase, ref, set } from "firebase/database";
            import { getAuth, createUserWithEmailAndPassword } from "firebase/auth";
            import { app } from "./firebase";
            import "./App.css";

            // const db = getDatabase(app);

            const auth = getAuth(app);

            function App() {
            // TO STORE A DATA INTO THE DATABASE
            /* const putData = () => {
                set(ref(db, "users/javed"), {
                id: 1,
                name: "Javed Hosamani",
                age: 21,
                });
            }; */

            // TO CREATE A NEW USER
            const signupUser = () => {
                createUserWithEmailAndPassword(auth, "javed@gmail.com", "javed@123").then(
                (value) => console.log(value)
                );
            };

            return (
                <div className="App">
                <h1>Firebase React App</h1>
                {/* <button onClick={putData}>Put Data</button> */}
                <button onClick={signupUser}>Create User</button>
                </div>
            );
